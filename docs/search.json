On the other hand, utility firms tend to have lower stock values due to the nature of their business, primarily dependent on consistent demand and regulated pricing. Understanding these distinctions is critical for investors looking to make educated decisions based on sectoral performance.",

The data encompasses details on market activity such as trades, order books, bid/ask prices, volumes, and timestamped events.\n\n2.1.2.1 Transaction Data\nEach trade, quote, and order is logged, providing insights into the dynamics of stock movements, liquidity, and market trends.\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Participants\nMarket participants, including broker-dealers and investors, generate real-time and historical data through their buying and selling activities.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Format and Frequency\nThe data will be accessed in formats like CSV, JSON, or XML, which are compatible with analysis tools such as Python or R. The frequency of updates varies:\n\nDaily Data: Updated at the end of each trading day.\nIntraday (Minute-Level) Data: Real-time updates available during market hours.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Key Data Dimensions\n\nDate: Trading date.\n\nOpen: Opening stock price.\n\nHigh: Highest price during the trading day.\n\nLow: Lowest price during the trading day.\n\nClose/Last: Closing price or last trade price.\n\nVolume: Total shares traded.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Potential Issues\n\nData Gaps: Missing data during market holidays or after-hours trading.\nAdjustments: Stock splits and dividends may require corrections for consistency.\n\nData Volume: Handling minute-level data over five years for multiple companies may require significant processing power and storage.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Data Import Plan\nThe data import strategy entails retrieving structured information from an API endpoint using HTTP requests that include appropriate headers to ensure successful communication. The JSON answer is processed and turned into a structured DataFrame, allowing for rapid data manipulation and analysis. Relevant data is then extracted and saved locally in a CSV file for further processing and analysis. This methodical methodology guarantees the smooth integration of raw data from an external source into a useful tabular format.\n\n\n2.1.7 Sources\nNasdaq’s market data services will be the primary source, with potential supplementary data from financial APIs or publicly available CSV datasets.",
